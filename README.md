`all-smi` monitors GPUs, NPUs, CPUs, and memory from one terminal — on your workstation or across a cluster. It also exports Prometheus metrics and machine-readable snapshots for monitoring systems and scripts.

- **Local and cluster views:** live utilization, memory, temperature, and power, with interactive sorting and filtering.
- **Multi-vendor monitoring:** NVIDIA, AMD, Intel, Apple Silicon, and accelerator-specific backends.
- **Remote access:** HTTP exporters or SSH, plus cluster-wide user and topology views.
- **Automation:** Prometheus, JSON/CSV snapshots, recording/replay, and a Rust library API.

## Supported hardware

| Platform | Hardware / coverage |
|---|---|
| Linux | NVIDIA, AMD Radeon/Instinct, Intel Arc/Iris Xe/Xe, NVIDIA Jetson |
| Linux accelerators | Intel Gaudi, Google Cloud TPU, Tenstorrent Wormhole/Blackhole, Rebellions ATOM/REBEL, Furiosa RNGD, AWS Trainium/Inferentia |
| macOS (Apple Silicon) | GPU, CPU, memory, ANE power, and thermal metrics; no sudo required |
| macOS (Intel) | CPU, memory, and chassis metrics; no GPU monitoring |
| Windows | NVIDIA, AMD, and Intel GPU backends, CPU and memory; sensor coverage depends on drivers and permissions |
| Windows on ARM64 | NVIDIA RTX Spark N1X: Blackwell GPU with its NPU shown as a DLA gauge, heterogeneous Cortex-X925 / A725 CPU cores; building from source needs LLVM (clang) |

Not every device exposes every metric. See [hardware requirements](docs/installation.md#platform-specific-requirements) for drivers, permissions, and limitations.

## Installation

### Metrum fork (this repository)

Deep-telemetry builds of this fork (NVIDIA GPM, NVML extras, and the DCGM plugin) are published as prebuilt archives on the [Metrum GitHub Releases](https://github.com/chetan-metrum-ai/all-smi/releases) page. On a GPU server, download `all-smi-linux-x86_64.tar.gz` and its `.sha256`, extract them, and run `./all-smi doctor`.

Tags use a `v*-metrum.N` suffix so they never collide with upstream [lablup/all-smi](https://github.com/lablup/all-smi) releases. macOS aarch64 zips are unsigned. musl archives omit the AMD and DCGM runtime plugins. On glibc Linux, keep `liball_smi_amd.so` and `liball_smi_dcgm.so` beside the binary. DCGM enrichment connects to an external NVIDIA DCGM hostengine (`nvidia-dcgm.service`); the plugin does not start an embedded hostengine. If the service is unavailable, DCGM fields are omitted while NVML/GPM collection continues.

This fork is not published to [crates.io](https://crates.io/crates/all-smi). `cargo install all-smi` installs the upstream crate and does not include the Metrum extras. To build this fork from source:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/chetan-metrum-ai/all-smi.git
cd all-smi
cargo build --release
```

Homebrew, the Ubuntu PPA, and the upstream release archives below are the upstream project. They do not include this fork's deep-telemetry extras.

### Homebrew (macOS / Linux)

```bash
brew install all-smi
```

### Ubuntu PPA

```bash
sudo add-apt-repository ppa:lablup/backend-ai
sudo apt update
sudo apt install all-smi
```

### Other installation methods

- [Pre-built binaries and Debian packages](docs/installation.md) are available from [GitHub Releases](https://github.com/lablup/all-smi/releases).
- **Cargo:** `cargo install all-smi` installs the upstream crate from crates.io — see [build prerequisites](docs/installation.md#option-5-install-from-cargo). It does not include Metrum deep-telemetry extras, and it does not install the Linux AMD companion library. Use a Metrum release archive or a source build of this fork when those extras are required.
- [Build from source](DEVELOPERS.md#building-from-source).

On glibc Linux, keep `liball_smi_amd.so` with the downloaded binary for AMD monitoring. The main binary can run without it. No container image is published.

## Quick start

### Monitor this machine

```bash
all-smi
```

With default settings this opens the local TUI. `all-smi local` selects it explicitly. Press `h` for help or `q` to quit. macOS does not require sudo; other platforms may need device permissions for particular readers.

### Monitor remote nodes

Start an exporter on each node:

```bash
all-smi api --port 9090
# For a local-only exporter on a shared host:
all-smi api --bind 127.0.0.1 --port 9090
```

Connect from your workstation:

```bash
all-smi view --hosts http://node1:9090 http://node2:9090
```

Metrics are available at `http://node1:9090/metrics`. By default, the API listens on all interfaces; use `--bind 127.0.0.1` for loopback-only access on shared hosts. Keep network-facing exporters on a trusted network; use your firewall or an authenticated proxy to control access. For machines without an exporter, see [SSH monitoring](docs/usage.md#agentless-ssh-mode).

### Export or capture metrics

```bash
# One-shot JSON (with default configuration)
all-smi snapshot

# Capture 30 seconds, then replay in the TUI
all-smi record --output trace.ndjson.zst --duration 30s
all-smi view --replay trace.ndjson.zst
```

See [snapshots and recording](docs/recording-and-scripting.md) for CSV, scripting, configuration caveats, and capture limitations.

### Check your environment

```bash
all-smi doctor
all-smi config path
all-smi --help
```

Configuration is optional. To keep an exporter running across reboots, follow the [service guide](docs/services.md) for your platform and installation method.

## Recent Updates

- **v0.28.1 (2026/10/20):** Added Rebellions REBEL100 support with per-process NPU utilization and SKU-based model labels, stopped reporting non-Habana accel nodes as Intel Gaudi, and updated russh and luwen.
